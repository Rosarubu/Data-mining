Zero-inflated Poisson regression is used to model count data that has an excess of zero counts.
Further, theory suggests that the excess zeros are generated by a _separate process_ from the count values and that the excess zeros can be modeled independently.  Thus, the zip model has _two_ parts, a Poisson count model and the logit model for predicting excess zeros.
